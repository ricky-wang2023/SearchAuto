# File Monitor Enhancements

## Overview

The File Monitor has been enhanced with **resume capability** and **smart processing** to address the issues where:
1. Script would restart processing from the beginning when interrupted
2. Script would process all files every time it was launched

## New Features

### üîÑ Resume Capability

**Problem**: When the script was stopped mid-process, it would lose track of which files were already processed and start over.

**Solution**: 
- Progress tracking is saved to `file_monitor_progress.json`
- Each processed file is recorded with its hash, status, and timestamp
- When resuming, the script checks which files are already processed and skips them

### üß† Smart Processing

**Problem**: The script would process all files every time it was launched, even if they were already converted.

**Solution**:
- Files are only processed if they haven't been successfully converted before
- File hashes are used to detect changes (if a file is modified, it will be reprocessed)
- Failed conversions are tracked and can be retried

### üìä Progress Management

**New UI Features**:
- **üìä Progress Button**: Shows statistics of processed files
- **üîÑ Reset Progress Button**: Clears all progress tracking to reprocess all files
- **Enhanced Logging**: Shows which files are skipped vs processed

## Technical Implementation

### Progress Tracking

```python
# Progress file structure (file_monitor_progress.json)
{
  "file_path": {
    "status": "completed|failed",
    "hash": "file_hash_for_change_detection", 
    "timestamp": "2024-01-01T12:00:00",
    "error": "error_message_if_failed"
  }
}
```

### Key Methods Added

- `load_progress()`: Load progress from JSON file
- `save_progress()`: Save progress to JSON file  
- `is_file_processed()`: Check if file was successfully processed
- `mark_file_processed()`: Mark file as successfully processed
- `mark_file_failed()`: Mark file as failed with error message
- `clear_progress()`: Clear all progress tracking
- `get_progress_stats()`: Get statistics about processed files
- `show_progress_stats()`: Display progress statistics in popup

### Smart Processing Logic

```python
# Check if file is already processed
if self.is_file_processed(file_path):
    self.log_message(f"‚è≠Ô∏è Skipping already processed: {os.path.basename(file_path)}")
    continue

# Process file and track result
if self.convert_file(file_path):
    self.mark_file_processed(file_path)
else:
    self.mark_file_failed(file_path, "Conversion failed")
```

## Usage

### Normal Operation

1. **First Run**: All files will be processed normally
2. **Subsequent Runs**: Only new or modified files will be processed
3. **Interrupted Runs**: Resume from where it left off

### Progress Management

- **View Progress**: Click "üìä Progress" button to see statistics
- **Reset Progress**: Click "üîÑ Reset Progress" to reprocess all files
- **Auto-Clear**: Progress is automatically cleared when output folders or monitor folders change

### Log Messages

The enhanced logging shows:
- `‚è≠Ô∏è Skipping already processed: filename.ext`
- `üîÑ Processing DOC file: filename.doc`
- `üìä Summary: X processed, Y skipped, Z total`

## File Structure

```
file_monitor.py                    # Enhanced main file
file_monitor_config.json           # Configuration (existing)
file_monitor_progress.json         # Progress tracking (new)
test_file_monitor_enhancements.py  # Test script (new)
```

## Benefits

1. **Time Saving**: No more reprocessing already converted files
2. **Resume Capability**: Can stop and resume processing without losing progress
3. **Better Monitoring**: Clear visibility into what's being processed vs skipped
4. **Error Tracking**: Failed conversions are tracked and can be retried
5. **Flexible Management**: Easy to reset progress when needed

## Testing

Run the test script to verify enhancements:

```bash
python test_file_monitor_enhancements.py
```

This will test:
- Progress tracking functionality
- Resume capability simulation  
- Smart processing logic

## Backward Compatibility

- All existing functionality remains unchanged
- Progress file is created automatically on first run
- No changes required to existing workflows
- Can be disabled by clearing progress

## Configuration

The progress tracking is automatic and requires no configuration. The progress file (`file_monitor_progress.json`) is created and managed automatically.

**Note**: If you change output folders or monitor folders, progress will be automatically cleared to ensure consistency.
